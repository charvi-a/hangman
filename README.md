# Let's play Hangman

I have made a hangman game as a personal project. This project has helped me to build my skills in python.  
I have used Tkinter to create a user interface. I have also made use of python modules like pycountry and random which allowed me to get a random name of a country that the user is required to guess.  
hangman tkinter.py uses Tkinter.  
hangman.py contains code which does not use Tkinter.  
I love playing games since it is a great way to stimulate the brain and have fun at the same time. Thus I thought of making this game.
